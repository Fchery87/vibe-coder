**Note:** The `builds` section with `"src": "package.json"` and `"use": "@vercel/static-build"` is a common configuration for projects using standard build tools. Vercel's framework detection often handles this automatically.

## Continuous Deployment

When you deploy via Git integration, Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment. Every time you push changes to your connected Git branch (usually `main` or `master`), Vercel will trigger a new deployment.

## Custom Domains

After deployment, you can easily add custom domains to your Vercel project through the project settings in the Vercel dashboard.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your project to Vercel and leverage its powerful features for frontend development.
