# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps to deploy your project to Vercel. Vercel is a cloud platform for frontend developers, providing a seamless experience for deploying and hosting Jamstack applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Vercel Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
- **Project Repository:** Your project code should be hosted on a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you have Node.js and a package manager installed locally for development.

## Deployment Steps

Vercel offers several ways to deploy your project. The most common and recommended method is through Git integration.

### Method 1: Deploy via Git Integration (Recommended)

1.  **Connect Your Git Provider:**
    - Log in to your Vercel dashboard.
    - Click "Add New..." and select "Project".
    - Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authorize Vercel to access your repositories.

2.  **Import Your Project:**
    - Select the repository containing your project.
    - Vercel will automatically detect your framework and build settings.

3.  **Configure Project Settings:**
    - **Project Name:** Vercel will suggest a name based on your repository. You can change it.
    - **Framework Preset:** Vercel usually detects this correctly. If not, select your framework (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte).
    - **Build and Output Settings:** Vercel's defaults are usually sufficient.
      - **Build Command:** This is the command Vercel runs to build your project (e.g., `npm run build`, `yarn build`, `next build`).
      - **Output Directory:** The directory where your built assets are placed (e.g., `dist`, `.next`, `build`).
      - **Install Command:** The command to install dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `yarn install`).
    - **Environment Variables:** If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), add them here. Vercel securely stores and injects these during the build and runtime.

4.  **Deploy:**
    - Click the "Deploy" button.
    - Vercel will clone your repository, install dependencies, build your project, and deploy it to its global edge network.

5.  **View Your Deployment:**
    - Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for your project.
    - You can view the deployment status, logs, and access your deployed site from the Vercel dashboard.
