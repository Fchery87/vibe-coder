## 🎯 Phase 1: Low-Risk, High-Impact Wins
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Impact:** VERY HIGH

### Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
**Why:** Industry standard (Linear, Cursor, VS Code). Keyboard-driven workflow enhancement.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Research and install `cmdk` library (or Radix UI Command)
2. [ ] Create `CommandPalette.tsx` component with overlay modal
3. [ ] Wire up keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K globally)
4. [ ] Add file switching commands (fuzzy search through open/recent files)
5. [ ] Add CLI command shortcuts (run common CLI commands)
6. [ ] Add settings/actions commands (open settings, create PR, save, etc.)
7. [ ] Test integration with existing system (ensure no conflicts)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use overlay/portal to avoid layout conflicts
- Non-invasive - existing UI remains untouched
- Commands should show keyboard shortcuts (e.g., "Open Settings - Cmd+,")

**References:**
- Linear: Cmd+K for global command menu
- Cursor: Cmd+Shift+P (inherited from VS Code)
- Best practice: Simple, memorable shortcut (Cmd+K or Cmd+P)

---

### Improved Diff Viewer
**Why:** VS Code-style toggleable views, editable diffs (GitHub Copilot pattern).

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Research and install `react-diff-view` library (2K+ stars, battle-tested)
2. [ ] Add side-by-side/inline toggle button to DiffViewer header
3. [ ] Enhance DiffViewer component with syntax highlighting
4. [ ] Add "Jump to Next Change" / "Jump to Previous Change" buttons
5. [ ] Test with various file types (JS, CSS, JSON) and large files

**Implementation Notes:**
- Enhance existing `DiffViewer.tsx`, don't replace
- VS Code command: `toggle.diff.renderSideBySide`
- GitHub Copilot: Highlights new files in green, allows in-diff editing

**Design Details:**
- Side-by-side: Two columns (before/after)
- Inline: Single column with +/- indicators
- Color coding: Red (deletions), Green (additions), Yellow (modifications)

---

### Notification Center with Actionable Toasts
**Why:** Current toasts disappear too fast. Persistent history improves UX.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Create notification history state management (array of past toasts)
2. [ ] Add bell icon in HeaderBar with unread badge count
3. [ ] Create notification drawer/panel component (slides from right)
4. [ ] Make toasts actionable with buttons (e.g., "File modified" → [View Diff])
5. [ ] Add "Clear All" and "Mark as Read" functionality

**Implementation Notes:**
- Keep existing Radix Toast system
- Store notifications in state with `{id, message, type, read, timestamp, actions}`
- Bell icon shows count of unread notifications
- Drawer shows last 50 notifications

**Actionable Toast Examples:**
- "File modified" → [View Diff] [Dismiss]
- "PR created" → [Open PR] [Copy URL]
- "Error occurred" → [View Details] [Retry]

---

### Phase 1 Testing
1. [ ] Full integration test of all Phase 1 features
   - Command palette doesn't conflict with existing shortcuts
   - Diff viewer renders correctly for all file types
   - Notifications persist and are actionable

---

## ⚡ Phase 2: Medium-Risk, High-Value Features
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** VERY HIGH

### Multi-File Tabs
**Why:** VS Code's tab system is the gold standard. Essential for real-world coding.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Design tab bar component layout (above editor)
2. [ ] Implement open files state management (`openTabs[]`, `activeTabId`)
3. [ ] Add tab close (X button) and switch functionality
4. [ ] Add unsaved changes indicators (dot on tab or asterisk)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Tab bar appears above MonacoEditor
- Each tab: `{id, filePath, fileName, isDirty, content}`
- Max visible tabs: 10 (overflow → dropdown)
- Middle-click to close tab (like browsers)

**State Management:**
```typescript
const [openTabs, setOpenTabs] = useState<Tab[]>([]);
const [activeTabId, setActiveTabId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

---

### Virtual Scrolling for CLI Output
**Why:** CLI with 100+ commands causes DOM bloat. Linear uses virtual scrolling.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Install `react-window` or `@tanstack/react-virtual`
2. [ ] Implement virtual list for CLI commands in AtlasCLI
3. [ ] Add "Clear CLI" button (trash icon in CLI header)
4. [ ] Performance test with 500+ commands (should maintain 60fps)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Wrap existing command list rendering with virtual scroller
- No changes to command logic - only rendering layer
- Auto-scroll to bottom when new command added

---

### Skeleton Loaders
**Why:** Users perceive apps as 40% faster with skeletons (Vercel v0, Linear pattern).

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Create skeleton components for file tree (`FileTreeSkeleton.tsx`)
2. [ ] Create skeleton components for editor (`EditorSkeleton.tsx`)
3. [ ] Add skeleton for CLI and webhook events
4. [ ] Integrate skeletons into loading states (show while fetching data)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Animated gradient/pulse effect
- Match actual component layout (same height, width, spacing)
- Show for minimum 200ms (avoid flash on fast loads)

**Example:**
```tsx
{isLoading ? <FileTreeSkeleton /> : <FileTree />}
```

---

### Phase 2 Testing
1. [ ] Full integration test of all Phase 2 features
   - Tabs work correctly with file modifications
   - Virtual scrolling handles edge cases (empty, 1 item, 1000 items)
   - Skeletons appear/disappear smoothly

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Advanced Differentiators
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 weeks
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** VERY HIGH (Unique Features)

### AI Model Comparison View (Killer Feature!)
**Why:** No other tool lets you run multiple models simultaneously and compare outputs.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Design 3-column comparison layout (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini side-by-side)
2. [ ] Add "Compare Models" button in settings or CLI
3. [ ] Implement parallel model execution (Promise.all with 3 providers)
4. [ ] Add voting/rating system for outputs (thumbs up/down per model)
5. [ ] Add cost/speed metrics display (tokens used, time taken)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Run same prompt through 3 different providers
- Show outputs in grid layout with syntax highlighting
- Store votes in localStorage or backend (analytics potential)
- Add "Use This Output" button per model

**UI Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   GPT-4o    │  Claude 3.5 │  Gemini 2.5 │
│  👍 85% 👎  │  👍 92% 👎  │  👍 78% 👎  │
│             │             │             │
│  [Output]   │  [Output]   │  [Output]   │
│             │             │             │
│ 450 tokens  │ 380 tokens  │ 520 tokens  │
│ 2.3s        │ 1.8s        │ 3.1s        │
│ [Use This]  │ [Use This]  │ [Use This]  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

---

### Workspace Presets & Templates
**Why:** Cursor has `.cursorrules`, Linear has saved filters. Reduces setup time.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Create preset save/load functionality (JSON format)
2. [ ] Add preset templates (React, Next.js, Node.js, Python)
3. [ ] Create preset management UI in settings

**Preset Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "React Development",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "allowFailover": true,
  "githubEnabled": true,
  "theme": "dark",
  "fontSize": 14
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Store in localStorage: `vibecoder_presets`
- Quick-load dropdown in settings
- Export/import presets (JSON file)

---

### Theme Customization
**Why:** Personalization increases user satisfaction and accessibility.

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Add accent color picker (let users choose purple/blue/green/orange)
2. [ ] Add font size controls (12px - 18px slider)
3. [ ] Add density mode toggle (compact/comfortable/spacious)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Update CSS variables dynamically
- Store preferences in localStorage
- Provide reset to defaults button

**CSS Variable Updates:**
```css
:root {
  --accent: <user-chosen-color>;
  --size-body: <user-chosen-size>;
  --gap-1: <density-based-spacing>;
}
```

---

### Phase 3 Testing
1. [ ] Full integration test of all Phase 3 features
   - Model comparison handles API failures gracefully
   - Presets load/save correctly
   - Theme changes apply immediately without page refresh

---

## ✨ Final Polish
**Estimated Time:** 1 week

1. [ ] Add micro-animations and transitions
   - File save indicator (checkmark animation)
   - Button hover ripples
   - Smooth panel slides
   - Code generation typewriter effect

2. [ ] Ensure responsive design on all breakpoints
   - Test on 1024px, 1280px, 1440px, 1920px
   - Mobile: collapsible panels, floating action button
   - Tablet: 2-column layout optimization

3. [ ] Update user documentation with new features
   - Create keyboard shortcuts reference
   - Add feature showcase GIFs
   - Update README.md

4. [ ] Complete end-to-end testing of entire application
   - Test all features together (not in isolation)
   - Check for memory leaks (DevTools Performance tab)
   - Lighthouse audit (aim for 90+ performance score)

---

## 🛡️ Safety Checklist (Before Each Phase)

- [ ] Create feature flag in settings (toggle new feature on/off)
- [ ] Work in isolated Git branch
- [ ] Test thoroughly before merging to main
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Add error boundaries (if feature fails, app still works)
