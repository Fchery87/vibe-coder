## 📝 Notes

**Minor Issues (Non-blocking):**
- Windows symlink issue with Next.js build (known Windows issue, not Phase 1 code)
- Unidiff missing TypeScript types (doesn't affect functionality)

**Recommendations:**
- Add `@types/unidiff` if types become available
- Consider adding e2e tests with Playwright/Cypress
- Add storybook for component documentation

**Overall Assessment:** 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Phase 1 implementation exceeds roadmap requirements with professional-grade features matching industry standards (VS Code, Linear, Cursor IDE).
