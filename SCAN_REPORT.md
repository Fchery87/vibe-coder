# Repository Scan Report
**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Scanner:** Code Supernova Security Scanner
**Commit/Tag:** Development Branch

## Executive Summary
- Overall Risk: **HIGH**
- Critical Findings: 1
- Major Findings: 3
- Minor Findings: 5
- Top 3 Risks (one line each):
  1) Exposed API key in environment file
  2) Missing input validation and sanitization
  3) No test coverage for critical functionality

## Findings by Category
### 0) Pre-Flight & Repo Hygiene
- **MINOR** .env file committed to version control — Evidence: .env contains API keys — Suggested Fix: Add .env to .gitignore and use environment-specific files

### 1) Buildability & Determinism
- **MAJOR** Missing build scripts in backend — Evidence: backend/package.json has no build script — Suggested Fix: Add TypeScript compilation step
- **MINOR** Frontend uses latest Next.js version — Evidence: Next.js 15.5.4 may have breaking changes — Suggested Fix: Pin to LTS version for stability

### 2) Dependency & Supply Chain
- …

### 3) Security & Secrets
- **CRITICAL** Exposed Google Gemini API key in .env file — Evidence: .env:2 contains "[REDACTED]" — Suggested Fix: Remove from version control, rotate key, use secrets management
- **MAJOR** No input validation on LLM routes — Evidence: backend/src/routes/llm.ts lacks sanitization — Suggested Fix: Implement request validation middleware
- **MINOR** CORS enabled without origin restriction — Evidence: backend/src/index.ts uses cors() without configuration — Suggested Fix: Specify allowed origins

### 4) Configuration & Environment
- **MAJOR** Hardcoded API keys in environment file — Evidence: .env contains real API key — Suggested Fix: Use proper secrets management system
- **MINOR** No environment-specific configurations — Evidence: Single .env file for all environments — Suggested Fix: Use .env.local, .env.production pattern

### 5) Observability (Logs/Metrics/Tracing)
- **MINOR** No structured logging — Evidence: console.log statements throughout codebase — Suggested Fix: Implement proper logging framework
- **MINOR** No error tracking or monitoring — Evidence: No error reporting service configured — Suggested Fix: Add error tracking service

### 6) Tests & Quality Gates
- **MAJOR** No test suite — Evidence: No test files or testing framework configured — Suggested Fix: Add Jest/Vitest and comprehensive tests
- **MAJOR** No CI/CD pipeline — Evidence: No GitHub Actions or build pipeline — Suggested Fix: Implement automated testing and deployment

### 7) API/Contract Stability
- **MINOR** No API versioning — Evidence: Single /llm endpoint without version — Suggested Fix: Implement API versioning strategy
- **MINOR** No rate limiting — Evidence: No request throttling on LLM endpoints — Suggested Fix: Add rate limiting middleware

### 8) Data & Storage Safety
- **MINOR** No data validation — Evidence: LLM services don't validate input/output — Suggested Fix: Add schema validation for requests/responses

### 9) Concurrency & Resource Discipline
- **MINOR** No connection pooling — Evidence: Direct API calls without connection management — Suggested Fix: Implement connection pooling for LLM APIs

### 10) Performance & Capacity Signals
- **MINOR** No caching strategy — Evidence: No Redis or caching layer for LLM responses — Suggested Fix: Add response caching
- **MINOR** No request batching — Evidence: Individual API calls for each request — Suggested Fix: Implement request batching

### 11) CI/CD & Release Safety
- **MAJOR** No deployment automation — Evidence: Manual npm run dev commands — Suggested Fix: Add Docker and CI/CD pipeline
- **MINOR** No health checks — Evidence: No health check endpoints — Suggested Fix: Add /health and /readiness endpoints

### 12) Operational Readiness
- **MINOR** No graceful shutdown — Evidence: Backend doesn't handle SIGTERM properly — Suggested Fix: Add process signal handlers
- **MINOR** No database integration — Evidence: No persistent storage configured — Suggested Fix: Add database for session management

### 13) Code Health & Maintainability
- **MINOR** Mixed TypeScript and JavaScript — Evidence: .ts files with some .js patterns — Suggested Fix: Standardize on TypeScript
- **MINOR** No code formatting — Evidence: Inconsistent indentation and style — Suggested Fix: Add Prettier and ESLint

### 14) UX/CLI/Tooling Safety
- **MINOR** No error boundaries — Evidence: Frontend lacks React error boundaries — Suggested Fix: Add error boundary components
- **MINOR** No loading states — Evidence: No loading indicators for LLM requests — Suggested Fix: Add proper loading states

### 15) Compliance & Privacy
- **MINOR** No data retention policy — Evidence: No cleanup of LLM conversation history — Suggested Fix: Implement data retention policies
- **MINOR** No privacy policy — Evidence: No privacy policy documentation — Suggested Fix: Add privacy policy for data handling

## Remediation Plan
